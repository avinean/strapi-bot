## ‚öôÔ∏è Local development

To test bot locally, you can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

First, run the Strapi server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
It will start the server on `http://localhost:1337`.\
Then, run ngrok:

```bash
ngrok http 1337
```
It will give you a public URL.\
Now, you can use this URL to set up the webhook in your bot.
```bash
https://<your-ngrok-url>/webhooks/telegram/webhook
```
After that you can set up the webhook in your bot.
```bash
curl -F "url={YOUR NGROK URL}" https://api.telegram.org/bot{YOUR_BOT_TOKEN}/setWebhook
```
